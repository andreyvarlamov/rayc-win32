Robots

Game mechanics
     Tool workshops take time to give upgraded gear
     Nice movement, very dynamic, quake like. If death, restart super quick
     At first just have to run around and get first gear, impossible to win otherwise
     Easy to die, no way to win against robots with no gear
     Have to run around and "parkour" until better gear
     (Can I jump with no vertical raycast?)
          I think it should be possible. Offset screen center. But also no vertical movement of fov, might be bad.

Story
     Revolutionary optimism in face of modernity's dissolution of all that is solid.
